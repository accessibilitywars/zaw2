Mukluk posted another LI build, this time for the Mirage.
With 1-2 buttons and options for CC and possible upgrades, this seems like a pretty reasonable build.
It's still a bit melee focused, but with a focus on clones and some offhand ranged options, that helps
for content that has positioning mechanics.

I've archived the build below, but [make sure to check out the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uarkTMktjZs) to see how to play it.

_Note: as we re-use the axe, put the more expensive torment sigil on the axe, as you only need one)_
