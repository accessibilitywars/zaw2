## OW Variant

For Open World, this Beastmastery variant works well.

Template code:

{{ chatlink(code="[&DQQeLSA+Nz6hAAAAvwAAAOkWAACsAQAAwAAAAD0lAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=]") }}

Pets: Juvenile Fanged Iboga / Juvenile Warthog<div data-armory-embed='skills' data-armory-ids='12489,12537,40498,12491,12580'></div><div data-armory-embed='specializations' data-armory-ids='30,32,55' data-armory-30-traits='1069,1846,1912' data-armory-32-traits='1072,970,1066' data-armory-55-traits='2071,2161,2143'></div>

## Crowd Control

If you have CC needs (blue breakbars), and can accommodate it, consider the following options.

- Concussion Shot <span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="12508"></span>
- Warthog <span data-aw2-key="F2" data-aw2-skill="46432"></span>
- Warthog Unmerge <span data-aw2-key="F5" data-aw2-skill="43014"></span>, wait for attack, Remerge <span data-aw2-key="F5" data-aw2-skill="42944"></span> when able

## Notes

**Important: this build has significant flanking bonuses. This nearly doubles damage if you're able to position to attack from the side or rear.**

1. Merge with pet <span data-aw2-key="F5" data-aw2-skill="42944"></span>, Autoattack, prioritizing flanking position
2. As in 1, + <span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="12468"></span>, <span data-aw2-key="4" data-aw2-skill="12507"></span>,  <span data-aw2-key="F1" data-aw2-skill="41406"></span> off cooldown
3. As in 2, + <span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="12537"></span>, <span data-aw2-key="8" data-aw2-skill="40498"></span> off cooldown

_Note: these are animation-free utilities and share cooldown timings. Position them next to each other on the skill bar, and hit both keys at the same time_

Elite skills are flexible and not particularly effective in this build. Generally choose Strength of the Pack (useful if alone), or Entangle for a bit of extra dps.

You can unmerge with your pet, and use it to tank for you. If your pet is about to die, merge and unmerge to refresh its health.
