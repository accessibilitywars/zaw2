20k dps D/D Quickness Catalyst. Build provides 25might, fury, quickness, prot, and high resistance. Can trade prot and resistance for vigor and resolution by swapping to water instead of earth in the rotation.
Exchanging the fire traitline for arcane with the same rotation provides identical 20k dps in addition to having higher boon duration and the revive trait; however, the fire traitline has the potential to do more dps with additional apm, but that would exceed the requirements.

## Gear

- Weapons: Berserker Dagger/Focus with Force/Accuracy Sigils
- Armor: Berserker Boots, the rest Diviner, all with Eagle Runes
- Trinkets: Diviner Accessories, the rest Berserker
- Food & Utility: Soy-Sesame Sous-Vide Steak, Ogre Sharpening Stone
