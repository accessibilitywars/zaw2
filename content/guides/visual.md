# Visual Accessibility in GW2

GW2 has a ways to go here, but there are some options available for those with visual needs.

To reduce visual complexity, you can change a few things in the graphics options to make the screen less busy:

- Effect LOD: will limit effects when many players are in the same spot
- Postprocessing: allows shader adjustment. If custom is used, individual settings can be toggled. I personally find Bloom particularly challenging.
- Disable Camera Shake
- Hide Ally Visual Effects: disables infusions and/or lengendary effects on other players
- Dynamic Hud: allows for disabling/hiding UI elements based on combat state
- Motion Blur Power
- Environment Zone Intensity: this doesn't affect much, but some maps (Dragon's End, Gyala Delves, etc) have precipitation effects that can be reduced
  > note: Bjora Marches' snowfall has a bug, and reducing the intensity with this slider seems to increase it

# Possible Future?

We have been in communication with [a plugin framework creator](https://raidcore.gg/Nexus) about adding screen reader functionality
to gw2 chat. It's not a reality yet, but it's within the realm of possibility.
