# Notes

Start by using Elixir of Promise and Elixir of Ambition to build up blight stacks. You should always start with these 2 skills after any prolonged phases of not attacking.

The rotation consists of 3 main combos:  
1. Pre Shroud  
1. In Shroud  
1. Out Shroud

And should be looped in this order indefinitely.

Pre Shroud combo consists of:  
1. Greatsword 5 Grasping Darkness  
1. Greatsword 4 Nightfall  
1. Well of Suffering  
1. Enter Shroud

In Shroud combo consists of:  
1. Shroud 3 Devouring Cut  
1. Shroud 2 Dark Barrage  
1. Do it 3 times  
1. Exit Shroud  

Basically Shroud 3 Devouring Cut has a very long after cast and you are using Shroud 2 Dark Barrage to cancel the after cast.

Out Shroud combo consists of:  
1. Greatsword 2 Gravedigger  
1. Greatsword 3 Death Spiral  
1. Auto Attack Chain  
1. Greatsword 2 Gravedigger  

You will know when your auto attack chain is completed when the cooldown of Greatsword 2 Gravedigger resets, in which case you should use it again immediately.

Below 50% boss HP, you will notice that Greatsword 2 Gravedigger has no cooldown. You should use it as much as possible and Out Shroud combo basically becomes spam Greatsword 2 Gravedigger until Enter Shroud is off cooldown.

If you find yourself being forced out of Shroud early, just carry on and do Out Shroud combo repeatedly until Greatsword 5 Grasping Darkness is off cooldown, then recover and continue the rotation.
