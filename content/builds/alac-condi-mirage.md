## Notes

---

The concept behind Alacrity Condition Mirage is that you want to use an Ambush attack ,specifically {{ skill(id="40184") }}, as much as possible, and how you get an Ambush attack is by dodging, or picking up Mirrors. Your next auto attack will be an Ambush after dodging or picking up a Mirror. This is especially important as it's designed to be a support build, and you will give Alacrity through your ambush attacks.

In this build Mirrors will be generated by False Oasis and Crystal Sands. False Oasis drops the Mirror where you're standing, but Crystal Sands drops the Mirror where you're aiming, and you want to always aim Crystal Sands inside the hitbox of the boss to ensure all of its hits land. This means you'll have to do the little wiggle I do to pick it up, or you can use Jaunt, which is a shadowstep, to pick it up.

Ambush attacks also provide high uptime of both Might and Fury for your subgroup.

This build has approximately 23 APM for just the weapon and utility skills, together with dodging. However, due to the high movement required, it is approximated at 40 APM instead, although it could be much lower and closer to 30 APM with better management of skills and mirrors.

## Build

{{ chatlink(code="[&DQcBJS09OxvuFQAA4BUAAIMBAACBAQAARhcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADWQAFAGYAAA==]") }}

## Rotation

---

Always start with:

**Opener:**
> 1. {{ skill(id="10216") }} (Staff 3)
> 1. {{ skill(id="10310") }} (Staff 2)
> 1. {{ skill(id="45449") }} back into melee range

To generate all 3 clones quickly.

You should use your skills off cooldown with the following priority:

**Skill Priority:**
> 1. {{ skill(id="10331") }} (Staff 4)
> 1. {{ skill(id="41065") }}, pick up the Mirror and Ambush. You can use Jaunt to pick it up for additional efficiency
> 1. Dodge and use {{ skill(id="40184") }} without letting your energy fill up completely
> 1. {{ skill(id="10169") }} (Staff 5)
> 1. {{ skill(id="40200") }} every 28s for the Mirror as well as Lesser Chaos Storm (traited, Chaos 1XX), you can use this off cooldown for a very minor DPS loss if it's too hard to track the cooldown
> 1. {{ skill(id="45449") }} without letting all 3 charges fill up

## Crowd Control

---

Your CC skills are, in order of priority:

**CC Skills:**
> 1. {{ skill(id="10169") }} (Staff 5) (Delay this skill in your rotation if you know a CC bar is coming up)
> 1. {{ skill(id="10287") }} (more clones more CC)
> 1. {{ skill(name="Signet of Midnight") }} (Small CC, moderate DPS loss)
> 1. {{ skill(name="Signet of Domination") }} (Big CC, big DPS loss)

## Advanced Tips

---

{{ skill(id="10192") }} is also a very long immune skill, scaling up to a maximum of 3 seconds with the number of clones you currently have, and should be your panic button. It can also be used to dodge mechanics on various raids to increase your damage uptime.

You will cast a {{ skill(id="13733") }} when you use {{ skill(id="40200") }}. However, {{ skill(id="40200") }} has a 19s cooldown while {{ skill(id="13733") }} has an internal cooldown (unseen) of 27s. You can delay casting {{ skill(id="40200") }} to once every 27s instead of casting it off cooldown for a minor DPS increase.
