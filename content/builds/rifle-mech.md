## Notes

---

Extremely simple build that does almost all of it's damage from range.

Highly recommended, beginner friendly build that can be played in all scenarios, whether it be instanced content such as fractals, raids, or strikes, or if you just need a safe, comfortable build for open world.

## Rotation

---

Rifle Mechanist has an extremely simple rotation.

Set all of your Mech skills to auto cast by right clicking them. Your Mech skills should be

**Mech Skills:**
> 1. {{ skill(id="63365") }}
> 1. {{ skill(id="63345") }}
> 1. {{ skill(id="63121") }}

and your rotation is to simply

**Press:**
> 1. {{ skill(id="6153") }} (Rifle 2)  
> 1. {{ skill(id="6004") }} (Rifle 3)
> 1. {{ skill(id="6154") }} (Rifle 4)
> 1. {{ skill(id="63095") }}  
> 1. {{ skill(id="6161") }}

off cooldown.

## Crowd Control

---

You have

**CC Skills:**
> 1. {{ skill(id="6154") }} (Rifle 4)
> 1. {{ skill(id="6161") }}
> 1. {{ skill(id="6004") }} (Rifle 3)
> 1. {{ skill(id="63095") }}
> 1. {{ skill(id="63253") }}

and they should be used in the listed order. You will notice that most of these skills are the same as skills you want to press in your main damage rotation.

As far as possible, try not to press {{ skill(id="63253") }} for CC as this will result in a large damage drop.

## Advanced Tipa

---

You can use
> 1. {{ skill(id="6005") }} (Rifle 5)
> 1. {{ skill(id="63111") }}

as movement skills to get to your objective or to escape from an enemy or mechanic. {{ skill(id="6005") }} (Rifle 5) is a leap type skill, while {{ skill(id="63111") }} is a Shadowstep (instantaneous teleport), and will thus be the more reliable escape skill.

{{ skill(id="63111") }} is also both a condition cleanse and a stun break, and can be used in the direst of situations as a get out of jail free card. However, using it could result in your Mech losing boons, and slightly decreasing your DPS output, hence user discretion is advised.

You can also skill click {{ skill(id="6005") }} (Rifle 5) to use it as a damage skill, increasing your DPS output. Skill clicking {{ skill(id="6005") }} (Rifle 5) makes you leap in place, reducing it's total cast time, allowing you to increase your DPS as it saves time over using it normally.

If you know when a CC bar is about to come up, it is recommended to save:
> 1. {{ skill(id="6154") }} (Rifle 4)
> 1. {{ skill(id="6161") }}
> 1. {{ skill(id="6004") }} (Rifle 3)

and use them only when the CC bar is up.

You can also recall your Mech using {{ skill(id="63089") }} and resummoning it with {{ skill(id="63050") }} for even more breakbar damage if required. Do take note that if your Mech has been damaged, you will not be able to resummon it immediately, hence you only want to do this if you are very familiar with the fight, as not having your Mech is a large DPS loss.
