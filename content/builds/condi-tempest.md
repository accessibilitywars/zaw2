## Notes

---

Simple, step based rotation with most of your damage in {{ skill(id="29719") }}.

The concept of this build relies on {{ trait(id="1503") }} resetting the cooldown of Air Attunement whenever you crit. The build will crit cap with Fury, and it is pretty much guaranteed that you will reset it as soon as you exit {{ skill(id="5494") }}.

## Gearing

	head="Sinister",

## Rotation

---

No attunement swapping required for this build! Just camp fire and press all of your skills off CD. Remember to prioritize Overload Fire as successfully completing an Overload gives you a **15%** damage boost!

Granting allies (or yourself) auras also gives you a large **10%** damage boost. You can do this with Overload Fire, and Focus 5 Fire Shield.

Swap into Air or Water for **HUGE** amounts of CC whenever needed, and Overload Air/Water/camp Earth after while waiting to re-enter Fire attunement. This will drop your DPS to the floor but eh, mechanics are IMPORTANT.
