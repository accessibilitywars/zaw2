## Notes

You have ONE combo to perform in this build, the rest of your skills are pressed off cooldown.

Here's the combo, which you should perform whenever {{ skill(id="12492") }} is off cooldown:

1. {{ skill(id="12492") }}
1. {{ skill(id="12633") }}
1. {{ skill(id="45717") }}
1. {{ skill(id="12639") }}

It is very easy to cancel {{ skill(id="12639") }} and you should take utmost care not to cancel it.

The rest of your skills that you should press off cooldown, preferably in the order stated below, but really in no particular order, are:

1. {{ skill(id="41406") }}
1. {{ skill(id="12638") }}
1. {{ skill(id="69203") }}
1. {{ skill(id="40729") }}

Auto attack to fill any gaps.

Technically using {{ skill(id="12482") }} is a DPS increase, but it has a long aftercast and cancelling aftercast is hard so we shall not press it.

The stated DPS of this build is 34.7k, but in reality this build performs MUCH better in raids. It has the highest burst damage in the game, and with many fights having multiple phases, in which your skills can cooldown between burst windows, Power Soulbeast will really start to shine.

## Crowd Control

Your CC skills are, in order of how you should use them:

1. {{ skill(id="46432") }}
1. {{ skill(id="12482") }}
1. {{ skill(id="12491") }}
