## Build
Heal Alacrity Build
{{ chatlink(code="[&DQExLS4tQRp/ADgBLQEtATYBSAEyATIBcRIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABMwAA]") }}

Bring {{ trait(id="617") }} if you are taking consecrations.

_This build is a simplified version of the heal alacrity build on [snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/builds/raids/guardian/heal-alacrity-willbender) with selective preferences for lower intensity. If you are able to adapt to the version on SC, feel free to follow their guide._


## Rotation and Utilities
**Heal Alac Rotation*
1. Use your virtues starting from {{ skill(id="62668") }}->{{ skill(id="62603") }}->{{ skill(id="62648") }}.
2. Auto Attack with minimal interruptions, using {{ skill(id="9084") }} can provide the group with permanent swiftness without interrupting your autos. 
3. Use F2 on cooldown, after F2, use F1/F3 to reposition. 
4. Use {{ skill(id="9153") }} when you require stability. 

_The importance of your auto attacks cannot be emphasized enough. Your auto attacks heal, provide alacrity, regeneration, might and protection and a field to trigger Relic of Karakosa with!_

**Burst Heals and Revives**
1. Use {{ skill(id="53482") }} (Hammer 2) for burst heals (due to Relic of Karakosa). You may refresh this skill using {{ skill(id="9124") }} (Hammer 4).
2. Use {{ skill(id="9083") }} for a burst heal.
3. Use {{ skill(id="9163") }} as an emergency revive.

**Crowd Control rotation**
1. You have decent CC by just using {{ skill(id="9124") }} (Hammer 4) and {{ skill(id="9260") }} (Hammer 3). 
2. You can extend your CC rotation by starting with {{ skill(id="53482") }} (Hammer 2) and refreshing it with {{ skill(id="9124") }} (Hammer 4)
3. If you need more CC you may bring {{ skill(id="9128") }}

**Hybrid DPS**
1. This build does decent DPS.
2. For low heal-pressure fights, you may bring more power traits to increase your DPS. 

**Other tips and tricks**
- You may drop {{ skill(id="9153") }} for different utilities.
- {{ skill(id="62648") }} allows you to shadow step through mechanics
- Blocking increases your heal power and doing so intelligently allows efficient use of {{ trait(id="1899") }}

5. W6 Qadim - You want to precast {{ skill(id="9128") }} for each CC phase and load the CC bar with {{ skill(id="9124") }} (Hammer 4) as soon as they appear
6. W7 Sabir - For the final phase if your group needs projectile blocks, consider {{ skill(id="9182") }} and {{ skill(id="9251") }}
