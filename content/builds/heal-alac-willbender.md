This is a very accessible build that requires minimal effort to play, where majority of its effects are based on auto-attacks. The end of the auto-attack chain {{ skill(id="9161") }} rely on {{ trait(id="558") }} to provide heals. You may find that DPS is fairly decent (for a healer).

This build is low cognition, low physical complexity, has very few repetitions and is functional in instanced content. This build requires only one weapon with no requirement of a weapon swap: Hammer!

# Gearing

{{ heavy(stat="Harrier's", rune="Monk") }}
{{ hammer(stat="Harrier's", sigils=["Transference", "Concentration"]) }}
{{ trinkets(stat="Harrier's", relic="Karakosa") }}

#### Budget Options

- Replace {{ item(name="Superior Rune of the Monk", id="24842") }} with {{ item(name="Superior Rune of Rebirth", id="84171") }}
- Replace {{ item(name="Superior Sigil of Transference", id="74326") }} with {{ item(name="Superior Sigil of Water", id="24551") }}

> <small>_Note: Weapon swap is optional, all the available options will lock you out of hammer and thus drop your boon coverage. Alternate weapon sets should be prioritised based on utility requirements._</small>

- {{ item(id="67528", name="Bountiful Maintenance Oil") }}

> <small>_This build is a simplified version of the heal alacrity build on [snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/builds/raids/guardian/heal-alacrity-willbender) with selective preferences for lower intensity. If you are able to adapt to the version on SC, feel free to follow their guide._</small>


## Rotation and Utilities

#### Heal Alac Rotation
1. Use your virtues starting from {{ skill(id="62668") }} (F1) -> {{ skill(id="62603") }} (F2) -> {{ skill(id="62648") }} (F3).
2. Auto Attack with minimal interruptions, using {{ skill(id="9084") }} can provide the group with permanent swiftness without interrupting your autos. 
3. Use {{ skill(id="62603") }} (F2) on cooldown, afterwards use {{ skill(id="62668") }} (F1)/{{ skill(id="62648") }} (F3) to reposition. 
4. Use {{ skill(id="9153") }} when you require stability. 

> <small>*The importance of your auto attacks cannot be emphasized enough. Your auto attacks heal, provide alacrity, regeneration, might and protection and a field to trigger Relic of Karakosa with!*</small>

#### Burst Heals and Revives
1. Use {{ skill(id="53482") }} (Hammer 2) for burst heals (due to Relic of Karakosa). You may refresh this skill using {{ skill(id="9124") }} (Hammer 4).
2. Use {{ skill(id="9083") }} for a burst heal.
3. Use {{ skill(id="9163") }} as an emergency revive.

#### Crowd Control rotation
1. You have decent CC by just using {{ skill(id="9124") }} (Hammer 4) and {{ skill(id="9260") }} (Hammer 3). 
2. You can extend your CC rotation by starting with {{ skill(id="53482") }} (Hammer 2) and refreshing it with {{ skill(id="9124") }} (Hammer 4).
3. If you need more CC you may bring {{ skill(id="9128") }}, which is ideally used in a precast scenario so you can top it up with Hammer 4.

#### Hybrid DPS
1. This build does decent DPS.
2. For low heal-pressure fights, you may bring more power traits to increase your DPS. 

#### Other tips and tricks
- You may drop {{ skill(id="9153") }} for different utilities.
- {{ skill(id="62648") }} allows you to shadow step through mechanics
- Blocking increases your heal power and doing so intelligently allows efficient use of {{ trait(id="1899") }}

## Optimisation
#### Raid Ready
1. W1 Gorseval - Immobilise your spirit with {{ skill(id="9151") }} and {{ skill(id="9260") }} (Hammer 3)
2. W1 Sabetha - You can teleport through flame wall with {{ skill(id="62648") }}. 
3. W2 Slothasor - Bring {{ trait(id="610") }} for additional condition cleanses.
4. W2 Matthias - Bring {{ skill(id="9251") }} for reflects. Bring {{ skill(id="9128") }} if you require more CC.
5. W3 Escort - This build is able to solo towers albeit a little slow with 6-8k dps. If you want to do the JP, bring {{ skill(id="29965") }} for a superspeed boost.
6. W4 Samarog - You may knock Rigom back with {{ skill(id="9124") }} (Hammer 4) and immobilise with {{ skill(id="9260") }} (Hammer 3) and {{ skill(id="9099") }} (Scepter 3). Bring {{ skill(id="9128") }} if you require more CC.
7. W4 Deimos - If you are the healer, due to the low toughness, you will probably be tasked to provide group aegis for the other DPS players.
8. W6 Conjured Amalgamate - Your power DPS can be quite significant despite being a healer. Do not stop attacking with autos. Place {{ skill(id="9128") }} when CA tosses out shields for a precast CC.
9. W6 Qadim - You want to precast {{ skill(id="9128") }} for each CC phase and load the CC bar with {{ skill(id="9124") }} (Hammer 4) as soon as the minibosses appear.
10. W7 Sabir - For the final phase if your group needs projectile blocks, consider {{ skill(id="9182") }} and {{ skill(id="9251") }} 

<small>With the new reduced cooldown, Mace/Focus can be an alternate weapon to tank, e.g. to block Deimos comfortably. However there are much better healing/tank options out there.</small>
