# Notes

- Shroud 1 autos are strong
- Use Shroud 2 when up close to maximise shotgun-style overlap
- Use Shroud 3 & 4 for movement, as well as Warhorn 5 and Spectral Walk
- Use Elixirs of Risk and Ambition, and Blood is Power before entering Shroud to pre-stack boons and blight. Most damage occurs during shroud.
- If getting overwhelmed, leave shroud early and use Elixir of Promise and Warhorn 5
- If quickness is not needed, swap Deathly Haste for Approaching Doom. *Probably?*
- Watch out for reflects, if your Shroud bullets are getting reflected, immediately exit shroud and use AoE attacks

# Crowd Control

- Pistol 3
- Warhorn 4
- Shroud 4
- Shroud 5
