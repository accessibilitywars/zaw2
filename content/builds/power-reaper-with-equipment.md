# Overview 

Classic power reaper spin to win playstyle. Generally speaking, this plays like:

- Step 1: Prep (with abilities/wells)
- Step 2: Spin
- Step 3: Repeat

# Gearing

This plays quite tanky and comfy. There are some modifications below to adjust.

- {{ item(name="Zojja's Masque") }} {{ item(id="24836") }}
- {{ item(name="Zojja's Epaulets") }} {{ item(id="24836") }}
- {{ item(name="Zojja's Doublet") }} {{ item(id="24836") }}
- {{ item(name="Zojja's Wristguards") }} {{ item(id="24836") }}
- {{ item(name="Zojja's Breeches") }} {{ item(id="24836") }}
- {{ item(name="Zojja's Footwear") }} {{ item(id="24836") }}

- Backpack: Dragon's
- Accessory 1: Dragon's
- Accessory 2: Dragon's
- Ring 1: Dragon's
- Ring 2: Dragon's
- Amulet: Dragon's
- Weapon A1: Greatsword, Berserker's, Superior Sigil of Force, Superior Sigil of Hydromancy
- Weapon B1: Sword, Berserker's, Superior Sigil of Force
- Weapon B2: Sword, Berserker's, Superior Sigil of Air

- {{ item(name="Relic of the Thief") }} or {{ item(id="100947", name="Relic of Fireworks") }}

## Alternatives and why...

- Cheaper/non-EoD option: Swap Dragon's for Berserker's
- Higher risk/higher-rewad: Swap Dragon's for Berserker's
- Dealing with percentage-based damage? Swap Dragon's for Berserker's
- Not comfy enough? Swap Scholar runes for Vampirism (only do this for Open World, as it will over-burden your healers in some raid scenarios)

# Rotation / Notes

- Pull enemies to melee range with {{ skill(name="Spectral Grasp") }} or {{ skill(name="Spectral Grasp") }}
- Hit enemies with {{ skill(name="death spiral") }} (Greatsword 3) to inflict vulnerability (and increase your crit chance)
- Hit enemies with {{ skill(name="Chilled to the Bone") }} to inflict chill (which grants might, life force and nova explosions every time you hit them)
- Go into {{ skill(name="Reaper's Shroud") }}, drop an ice field with {{ skill(id="30557", name="Executioner's Scythe") }}
- Use {{ skill(id="30504", name="Soul Spiral") }} in the ice field
- When out of shroud, focus on life force generation with weapons and {{ skill(name="Your Soul is Mine") }}
- Dual-swords are provided as a utility option. If you don't own SotO, use axe/warhorn instead.
  - Sword 1/4 will heal
  - Sword 3 provides rapid movement (sacrificing health to move again)
  - Sword 2/5 generate additional life force (note: sacrificing health for second use does not build life force)

# Crowd Control

You have several options:

- {{ skill(name="grasping darkness") }} (Greatsword 5)
- {{ skill(name="executioner's scythe") }} (Shroud 5)
- {{ skill(name="Chilled to the Bone") }}
- {{ skill(name="Spectral Grasp") }}
