Absolutely everything this build uses extends berserk. Your goal is to get into berserk as fast as possible and stay there, as long as you're hitting
targets. The main difficulty is going to be to re-engage with the next target once you kill something.

This build is tested with no weapon swapping. A hammer second weapon set is provided only as CC support. Dual maces can work well too.

#### SPECIAL NOTE

This is one of our more challenging builds. It's relatively simple, but unforgiving. We'll keep looking for a more
accessible warrior option.
