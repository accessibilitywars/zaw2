## Notes

---

Power Berserker is a very strong build for instanced content, even with a simplified rotation.

With the usage of Spear as the main weapon, it further has high range, allowing you to deal great damage with flexible positioning.

It's also a great pick for solo gameplay, as it provides itself with good amounts of the most essential offensive boons: Quickness, Fury, and Might.
