## Notes

This is a build which uses mostly Grieving gear and hybrid traits to maximise the sword's physical prowress and bleeding capabilities.

## Rotation
---

#### Opener
> 1. Signets (Can be cast very early to maintain 5 stacks)
> 1. {{ skill(id="77342") }}
> 1. {{ skill(id="14402") }}
> 
> - <small>None of these skills will trigger the boss fight, and you can perpetually keep refreshing signet until the fight begins.</small>
> - <small>{{ skill(id="14410") }} and {{ skill(id="14402") }} provide adrenaline so use it just before the fight starts.</small>

#### Skill Priority
Use the following off-cooldown
> 1. {{ skill(id="14428") }} (⚔ Burst)
> 1. {{ skill(id="14498") }} (⚔ 4)
> 1. {{ skill(id="14497") }} (⚔ 3)
> 1. {{ skill(id="14413") }}
> 1. {{ skill(id="14404") }} (if required)
> 1. Other Signets only if required
> 
>> - Try to maintain 4-5 stacks of {{ trait(id="1344") }}.
>> - {{ skill(id="14413") }} has no cast time.
>> - {{ skill(id="14404") }} has no cast time.

#### Crowd Control
This build has very poor CC options and you may bring additional CC by sacrificing {{ skill(id="14413") }} and using other signets instead. {{ trait(id="1344") }} will be harder to maintain. 
> 1. {{ skill(id="77114") }}
> 1. {{ skill(id="14502") }}
> 1. {{ skill(id="14415") }} (swap to mace for CC)

#### Sustain in Open World
> 1. Switch to {{ skill(id="14389") }} for baseline healing and to maintain {{ trait(id="1344") }}
> 2. Use **Relic of the Biomancer** for baseline healing
> 3. Use {{ skill(id="76562") }} in emergencies

> - This bench was performed with 2 expertise infusions and missing most of the other infusions.
> - This bench is not grinded and you may be able to surpass this number up to 38k.
> - The complexity and damage ceiling of this build is low, so do not expect a much higher performance above 39k DPS.
