## Notes

Power Holosmith, played in this rotation, can be summed up by having a skill priority order and pressing skills off cooldown, with the exception of Laser Disc and Prime Light Beam. These 2 skills have the additional condition of needing to be pressed above 50% heat.

The highest priority skills are:

- Particle Accelerator
- Surprise Shot
- Blade Burst

They are all the same priority as each other as none of these 3 skills have a cast time, and can be cast anytime without interrupting any of your skills or auto attack chain.

In Photon Forge mode, your skill priorities are:

1. {{ skill(id="44530") }} (Forge 3)
2. {{ skill(id="45783") }} (Forge 4)
3. {{ skill(id="42842") }} (above 50% heat)
4. {{ skill(id="42009") }} (above 50% heat)
5. Auto attack when you can't press any buttons.

Outside of Photon Forge, your skill priorities are:

1. {{ skill(id="40160") }} (Sword 3)
2. {{ skill(id="44110") }} (Sword 2)
3. {{ skill(id="43739") }} -> {{ skill(name="Launch Wall") }} (spam the button)
4. Auto attack when you can't press any buttons.

## Crowd Control

Your CC skills are {{ skill(id="6053") }} (Shield 4), which is a 3s long projectile reflect, and can be pressed twice in quick succession for CC, {{ skill(id="6054") }} (Shield 5), which is a 2.5s long block, and is basically your panic button. It can also be pressed twice in quick succession for CC. You can also swap out Rifle Turret for Throw Mine, and if you need even more CC, swap out Photon Wall for Personal Battering Ram.
