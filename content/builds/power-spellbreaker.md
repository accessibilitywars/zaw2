The purpose of writing this guide is to provide a low intensity method to play PvE spellbreaker without the need to learn opening chains and reducing variance. This build is low cognition, has low physical complexity, and has very few repetitions, relying on short bursts to refresh relics periodically. The way bursts work on warrior prevents you from cancelling your autos unnecessarily. This build is functional in both open world and instanced content. There is an optional amount of APM to push the build to its limit but this build already does 20k on autos alone and is therefore minimally qualified to clear all 7 wings with ease. While this build has a low skill floor, it has a low damage ceiling as well but opens up a path to upskill via weapon and trait changes.

This simplified build also embraces the combo nature of warrior instead of shunning it, which is extremely useful when learning the class for the frist time. While this build is historically popular, since relic changes, there are very few guides that explain this build at the time of writing.

**Trait Alternatives**
There is a good [build on SnowCrow's](https://snowcrows.com/builds/raids/warrior/power-spellbreaker) which uses the Defense trait which is out of the scope of this article.

## Rotation and Utilities
**General concept**
The build relies on the auto chain, which is just F1 (press and hold). This will provide a baseline DPS of 21-23k.
The build can be enhanced further by triggering relics, signets and traits through a sequence of skills which constitutes the basics of playing warrior, combos. 
The combo is a tight chain of skills that eventually builds up to an extremely buffed ultimate attack.
Almost every warrior build will require learning of combos, otherwise you will remain at the baseline DPS or lower. 
This combo is simplified and broken down into the table below. 

| Effect     | Notes              |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| SignetF  | Burst window (4s)    |
| Relic    | Using skills 2-5     |
| PeakP    | Physical skill (6s)  |
| AInsight | Disables (5 stacks)  |
| BPower   | Using a    |  

**Why Kick?**
Kick is an irritating skill that can kick non-defiant foes away from your range. But it has some versatility that provides advantages against other physical skills.
1. Triggers both AI and Peak performance at the same time
2. You can get more stacks of AI because it could potentially hit more than 1 target (compared to bull's charge)
3. It can be used as a movement skill.

**Precasts**
You may cast the Elite skills depending on personal preference.



**DPS Rotation**
Burst Opener - Kick + Burst (F1) (A3/A4 if available) + Signet of Fury
1. Burst opener + A5 
2. Weapon swap -> Auto Chain + hold F1 button 
3. Burst opener + D4 D5 
4. Weapon swap -> Auto Chain + hold F1 button 
5. Repeat steps 1-4
*You may extend the auto chain cycle if your skill 5 is not ready by holding F1. You may also extend the chain indefinitely by just holding F1 and it will still do a base of 20k DPS at almost 0 APM*

**Crowd Control rotation**
1. You have decent CC by using dagger 3 and Throw bolas.
2. You may bring Bull's Charge or Kick if you still need more CC
3. Full Counter provides breakbar damage too and is useful if you know the fight well. 
4. Consider hammer as an alternative weapon set (refer to trait alternatives)

**Sustainability**
1. Your OH dagger set is designed for sustain.
2. Defiant stance can be taken instead to cheese certain mechanics (see *Raid Ready* section)

## Optimisation
This build has no ranged alternative. However, based on my personal testing, this build does more damage on mobile fights (like Twin Largos) than Condition Berserker. If you find yourself being forced out of range often, you might want to play a different class. 

**Raid Ready**
1. W1 Vale Guardian - Boon strip can be used on the Blue Boss.
2. W1 Gorseval - Throw bolas is a really long immobilise that can extend the split phase.
3. W2 Slothasor - You can bring permanent self stability via Brave Stride and drop your physical skills for party wide Break Stuns and Condi Cleanse Shake it off. 
4. W3 Keep Construct - This build is excellent on this fight. 
5. W3 Xera - During planning for the split phase, you want to inform your party that you do not have any meaningful ranged damage. If forced to take a pressure pad, your only damage skills are throw axe and throw bolas which are effectively neglible. 
6. W4 Deimos - Throw bolas at prides is an effective immobilize as part of your rotation. I do not recommending killing the prides until they are near saul.
7. W5 Soulless Horror - It is probably a good idea to never bring the build here. If you do however, do not use Axe 5 when TD is about to spawn. Do the burst combo after TD is pushed out. 
8. W6 Conjured Amalgamate - The amount of cleave on this fight is amazing. 

W6 Qadim - While solo lamp is ideally performed using daredevil (same equipment), you may choose to use this build instead if 2 players are sent to do Lamp. 
4.  W7 QtP - This build is able to pylon kite. A video is provided for reference.

I have benched the build with 1 piece of marauder's headgear, budget food and utilities, no infusions.
