## Notes

---

Power Spellbreaker is a priority based build focused on simple combos and pressing them off cooldown.

It does short and decently high burst damage with little or no set up, and is strong on bosses with many short burst phases. It also performs well on long fights due to its high bench damage, and ability to burst often. Furthermore, Power Spellbreaker also ranks very well in damage/action, and is one of our best performing builds in that metric.

However, it has multiple skills with forced movement, animation lock, and long channelling times, increasing its difficulty of play in other aspects than just APM. It also has low CC, making it bad for fights with CC, but that can be fixed by swapping out utility skills

## Rotation

---

The rotation for Power Spellbreaker consists of a pre-cast, and pressing 2 simple combos, {{ skill(id="45252") }}, and {{ skill(id="14413") }} off cooldown.

Your pre-cast skills are:

**Pre-cast:**
> 1. {{ skill(id="14389") }}
> 1. {{ skill(id="14355") }}
> 1. {{ skill(id="14413") }}
> 1. {{ skill(id="14410") }}

And you should always cast all 4 skills before you hit the boss. As both {{ skill(id="14413") }} and {{ skill(id="14410") }} have no cast time, it should take around 2 seconds to cast all 4 skills, allowing it to be very consistently cast at the start of each fight.

Listed below are the skills that you should always combo:

**Combo 1:**
> 1. {{ skill(id="14399") }} (Axe 5)
> 1. {{ skill(id="14418") }} (Axe 4)

**Combo 2:**
> 1. {{ skill(id="44937") }} (Dagger 3)
> 1. {{ skill(id="46233") }} (Dagger 2)

And the priority you should assign for your skills and combo are:

**Rotation Priority:**
> 1. {{ skill(id="45252") }}
> 1. Combo 1
> 1. Combo 2
> 1. {{ skill(id="14413") }}

Advanced players should note that {{ skill(id="14413") }} does not have a cast time, nor will it interrupt the current skill that is being casted, and can be pressed anytime as soon as it is off cooldown.

While the rotation itself is simple with few steps, do take note that both {{ skill(id="45252") }} and {{ skill(id="46233") }} (Dagger 2) are leap skills, and will have forced movement and animation lock when you are casting them. This may cause you to become badly positioned or hit by some mechanics as you are not able to dodge during this time.

{{ skill(id="14399") }} (Axe 5) also has a long channel time, and while you can move during the channel, dodging or casting another skill will end it prematurely, resulting in a loss of damage. You should thus always hold {{ skill(id="14418") }} (Axe 4) until you have finished casting {{ skill(id="14399") }} (Axe 5), and it is better to skip {{ skill(id="14418") }} (Axe 4) altogether than to cancel {{ skill(id="14399") }} (Axe 5).

## Crowd Control

---

You only have one CC skill in this build, {{ skill(id="44937") }} (Dagger 3), and as it is used as part of your damage rotation, may not be off cooldown when you need to CC.

For fights requiring CC, it is recommended to swap out {{ skill(id="14413") }} for {{ skill(id="14502") }}, and use {{ skill(id="14502") }} only when you need to CC. This will result in a small DPS decrease to about ~35.0k, which is still good considering the overall simplicity of the build.

## Advanced Tips

---

For fights with multiple phases, you should always recast your pre-cast skills at the start of each phase, ensuring that you both maximise your burst damage, as well as having enough Adrenaline to actually perform your rotation.

<div style=‘clear:both;’>&nbsp;</div>

{{ skill(id="14413") }} provides an insanely high 10 stacks of stability when cast, and can be delayed to be used for skipping various fight mechanics. These 10 stacks of stability lasts 8 seconds, providing a very forgiving window between pressing {{ skill(id="14413") }} and the mechanic happening.

<div style=‘clear:both;’>&nbsp;</div>

You can gain more DPS while having an easily accessible CC button by swapping out {{ skill(id="14413") }} for {{ skill(id="14502") }}. Use {{ skill(id="14502") }} off cooldown, inserting it to the bottom of your priority list, while maintaining at least 1 stack of {{ skill(id="14502") }} for any CC bars. You can also only use 1 stack of {{ skill(id="14502") }}, saving 2 stacks for more CC, and it will still be a DPS increase over {{ skill(id="14413") }}.

This can be done for all fights, but is highly recommended for fights with many phases and requiring high CC.
