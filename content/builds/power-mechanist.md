## Build

{{ chatlink(code="[&DQMGOyYnRh8NGwAAowAAABobAAAQGwAACRsAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=]") }}

## Notes

To play this build, you want to place

- {{ skill(id="5818") }}

at the start of the fight, then press

1. {{ skill(id="30713") }} (Hammer 5)
1. {{ skill(id="30088") }} (Hammer 2)
1. {{ skill(id="63095") }}

off cooldown, and that is basically your rotation.

## Crowd Control

You have decent CC. Primarily, {{ skill(id="30665") }} (Hammer 3) will make your Mech do Rocket Punch, which is a CC, but do take note that since the cooldown of Rocket Punch is longer than that of
Rocket Charge it will not always be available.

Other CC skills that you have are:

- {{ skill(id="63253") }}
- {{ skill(id="63095") }}

If you still need more CC, replace 

- {{ skill(id="5818") }}

with 

- {{ skill(id="6161") }}
