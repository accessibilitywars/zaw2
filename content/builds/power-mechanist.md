## Notes

To play this build, you want to place
<span data-aw2-key="7" data-aw2-skill="5818"/>Rifle Turret
at the start of the fight, then press
<span data-aw2-key="5" data-aw2-skill="30713"/>Hammer 5 Thunderclap, 
<span data-aw2-key="2" data-aw2-skill="30088"/>Hammer 2 Electro-Whirl, and
<span data-aw2-key="0" data-aw2-skill="63095"/>Overclock Signet
off cooldown, and that is basically your rotation.

## Crowd Control

You have decent CC. Primarily, <span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="30665"/>Hammer 3 Rocket Charge
will make your Mech do Rocket Punch, which is a CC, but do take note that since the cooldown of Rocket Punch is longer than that of
<span data-aw2-key="3" data-aw2-skill="30665"/>Hammer 3 Rocket Charge
it will not always be available.

Other CC skills that you have are:
- <span data-aw2-key="8" data-aw2-skill="63253"/>Force Signet
- <span data-aw2-key="0" data-aw2-skill="63095"/>Overclock Signet

If you still need more CC, replace 
<span data-aw2-skill="5818"/>Rifle Turret with
<span data-aw2-skill="6161"/>Throw Mine.
