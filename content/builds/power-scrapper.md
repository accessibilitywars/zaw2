## Build

{{ chatlink(code="[&DQMGNyYvKz3ZEioPJgGGAK4SowCGAAAAgxISAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADWgBXAFUAAA==]") }}

## Notes

Use off cooldown:
1. {{ skill(id="29921") }}
1. {{ skill(id="30713") }} (Hammer 5)
1. {{ skill(id="30088") }} (Hammer 2)
1. {{ skill(id="5810") }}
1. {{ skill(id="6161") }}
1. {{ skill(id="6164") }} (press this twice)

You want to try to maintain as much superspeed as possible as that increases your DPS. You can do this by using {{ skill(id="30357") }} opposite to {{ skill(id="29921") }}, when {{ skill(id="29921") }} has 10s of cooldown left. You can also press it before you press any high damage skill if you forgot to use it before, but generally this ensures you have a high uptime of superspeed, increasing your damage.

## Crowd Control

Your CC skills are:
1. {{ skill(id="31167") }}
1. {{ skill(id="6161") }}
1. {{ skill(id="6164") }}
1. {{ skill(id="30713") }} (Hammer 5)

You can also use {{ skill(id="56920") }} if you have allies that have been downed, and this will summon up to 3 seperate Gyros, which will automatically go revive allies nearby.
