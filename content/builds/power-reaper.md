# Overview 

Classic power reaper spin to win playstyle. Generally speaking, this plays like:

- Step 1: Prep (with abilities/wells)
- Step 2: Spin
- Step 3: Repeat

# Gearing

This plays quite tanky and comfy. There are some modifications below to adjust.

{{ light(stat="Berserker's", rune="Scholar") }}
{{ greatsword(stat="Berserker's", sigils=["Force", "Hydromancy"]) }}
{{ sword_main(stat="Berserker's", sigil="Force") }}
{{ sword_off(stat="Berserker's", sigil="Air") }}
{{ trinkets(stat="Dragon's", relic="Thief", alternative="Fireworks") }}

# Build

{{ chatlink(code="[&DQgTHjIlIj7BEgAAdwEAAPoAAAC9AQAAAxMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=]") }}

## Alternatives and why...

- Cheaper/non-EoD option: Swap Dragon's for Berserker's
- Higher risk/higher-rewad: Swap Dragon's for Berserker's
- Dealing with percentage-based damage? Swap Dragon's for Berserker's
- Not comfy enough? Swap Scholar runes for Vampirism (only do this for Open World, as it will over-burden your healers in some raid scenarios)

# Rotation / Notes

- Pull enemies to melee range with {{ skill(name="Spectral Grasp") }} or {{ skill(name="Grasping Darkness") }}
- Hit enemies with {{ skill(name="death spiral") }} (Greatsword 3) to inflict vulnerability (and increase your crit chance)
- Hit enemies with {{ skill(name="Chilled to the Bone") }} to inflict chill (which grants might, life force and nova explosions every time you hit them)
- Go into {{ skill(name="Reaper's Shroud") }}, drop an ice field with {{ skill(id="30557", name="Executioner's Scythe") }}
- Use {{ skill(id="30504", name="Soul Spiral") }} in the ice field
- When out of shroud, focus on life force generation with weapons and {{ skill(name="Your Soul is Mine") }}
- Dual-swords are provided as a utility option. If you don't own SotO, use axe/warhorn instead.
  - Sword 1/4 will heal
  - Sword 3 provides rapid movement (sacrificing health to move again)
  - Sword 2/5 generate additional life force (note: sacrificing health for second use does not build life force)

# Crowd Control

You have several options:

- {{ skill(name="grasping darkness") }} (Greatsword 5)
- {{ skill(name="executioner's scythe") }} (Shroud 5)
- {{ skill(name="Chilled to the Bone") }}
- {{ skill(name="Spectral Grasp") }}
