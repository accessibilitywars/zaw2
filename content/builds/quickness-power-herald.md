## Build

{{ chatlink(code="[&DQkPKgM2NBfcEdwRBhIGEisSKxLUEdQRyhHKEQIBAgAGEtQRKxIAAAAAAAADawA1AAUAAA==]") }}

## Notes

Use:
1. {{ skill(id="27107") }} while in {{ skill(id="28134") }}  
1. {{ skill(id="28379") }}, {{ skill(id="27760") }}, and {{ skill(id="26644") }} in {{ skill(id="28085") }}. Use {{ skill(id="26644") }} again (it should now be {{ skill(id="28113") }}) to consume it.

Swap legends off cooldown in {{ skill(id="28134") }}, and swap legends once you have use {{ skill(id="28113") }} twice in {{ skill(id="28085") }}

Use off cooldown:

1. {{ skill(id="27074") }} (Sword 5)
1. {{ skill(id="28472") }} (Sword 4)
1. {{ skill(id="29233") }} (Sword 2)

Following the above, you should never run out of energy, unless you have to CC.

## Crowd Control

You should always swap to your Staff for CC. Part of your job as a boon DPS is to do everything possible to get the most damage out of your DPS players, and this includes giving them boons and CCing so they don't have to.

Your CC skills are:
1. {{ skill(id="28978") }} (Staff 5)  
1. {{ skill(id="28075") }} ({{ skill(id="27760") }} flipped skill) in {{ skill(id="28085") }}  
1. {{ skill(id="28406") }} (in {{ skill(id="28134") }})
