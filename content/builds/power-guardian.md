+++

The purpose of writing this guide is to provide an ultra low intensity method to play PvE Core Guardian while easily hitting the 70% benchmark with minimal effort. This is a Core Guardian variant which provides more selfless support. This build is low cognition, low physical complexity but has somewhat repetitive (spamming virtues) requirement due to its dependency on resolution uptime. It remains a very strong contender (and sometimes superior to DH) and provides an alternative to players without access to Dragonhunter.

The utilities do not require specific timing and do not interrupt the auto attack nature of the build. This build requires only one weapon to deal damage to near competitive levels with no requirement of a weapon swap: Hammer!

	relic="Brawler") }}

#### Weapon Swap
Weapon swap is optional, all the available options will massively reduce DPS and lock you out of hammer, they should be prioritised based on utility requirements.
1. Bow - Bow provides a ranged option for bosses with melee DPS downtime. 
2. Scepter/Focus - Provides a decent immobilise option with some ranged DPS.
