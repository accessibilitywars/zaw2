## Build

{{ chatlink(code="[&DQMGNyYvRh4NGyoPJgGGABobowAQGwAACRsSAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADWgA2ADMAAA==]") }}

## Notes

Press

1. {{ skill(id="44110") }} (Sword 2)  
1. {{ skill(id="40160") }} (Sword 3)  
1. {{ skill(id="63095") }}  
1. {{ skill(id="6161") }}

off cooldown, and that is basically your rotation.

Your auto attack chain reduces the cooldown of {{ skill(id="44110") }} (Sword 2) and {{ skill(id="40160") }} (Sword 3), allowing you to cast them more often. This lines up pretty well and results in you being able to use {{ skill(id="40160") }} (Sword 3) every other time you use {{ skill(id="44110") }} (Sword 2). Using {{ skill(id="6161") }} does NOT cancel your auto attack chain so you don't have to worry about managing it, spam away.

You have very nice utilities with the Shield. You can bring a Pistol instead for about 1k+ more DPS, but I will always recommend the Shield over Pistol. 

{{ skill(id="6053") }} (Shield 4) is a 3s long projectile reflect, and can be pressed twice in quick succession for CC. 

{{ skill(id="6054") }} (Shield 5) is a 2.5s long block, and is basically your panic button. It can also be pressed twice in quick succession for CC.

On top of that, you have {{ skill(id="6161") }} and {{ skill(id="63095") }}, which are both CC skills even though they are being used primarily for damage. Finally, you have {{ skill(id="63253") }}, which is another CC skill, but you should only use it in the most dire of situations, as using it is a DPS loss.
