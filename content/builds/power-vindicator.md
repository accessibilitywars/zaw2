## Notes

Power Vindicator can be very easy to play, yet deliver respectable results by following the steps below:

{{ skill(id="28134") }}Swap your legend when it is off cooldown
or when you run out of energy, it doesn't matter much, and use
{{ skill(id="27107") }} Impossible Odds while in Shiro, and
{{ skill(id="26557") }} Vengeful Hammers while in Jalis. You can bind both these skills to the same button to reduce mistakes.

Use off cooldown in following priority:

1. {{ skill(id="27074") }} Sword 5 Deathstrike
2. {{ skill(id="28472") }} Sword 4 Shackling Wave
3. {{ skill(id="29233") }} Sword 2 Chilling Isolation

Dodge to start the fight and dodge when your endurance is almost full. 

Auto attack to fill.

## Crowd Control

Your CC skills are:

- {{ skill(id="26679", name="Jalis - Forced Engagement") }}
- {{ skill(id="28406", name="Shiro - Jade Winds") }}
- {{ skill(id="28472", name="Sword4 Shackling Wave") }}

However, if you're in a position where not CCing will result in failure, just swap to staff and use
{{ skill(id="28978", name="Staff 5 Surge of the Mists") }}.
Note that this will tank your DPS and the only thing you can do now is to auto attack (while still dodging and swapping legends).
