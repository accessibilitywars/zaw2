## Notes

Power Vindicator can be very easy to play, yet deliver respectable results by following the steps below:

Swap your legend when it is off cooldown or when you run out of energy, it doesn't matter much, and use:

1. {{ skill(id="27107") }} while in {{ skill(id="28134") }}
1. {{ skill(id="26557") }} while in {{ skill(id="28419") }}

You can bind both these skills to the same button to reduce mistakes.

Use off cooldown in following priority:

1. {{ skill(id="27074") }} (Sword 5)
2. {{ skill(id="28472") }} (Sword 4)
3. {{ skill(id="29233") }} (Sword 2)

Dodge to start the fight and dodge when your endurance is almost full. 

Auto attack to fill.

## Crowd Control

Your CC skills are:

- {{ skill(id="26679") }}
- {{ skill(id="28406") }}
- {{ skill(id="28472") }} (Sword 4)

However, if you're in a position where not CCing will result in failure, just swap to staff and use
{{ skill(id="28978") }} (Staff 5)

Note that this will tank your DPS and the only thing you can do now is to auto attack (while still dodging and swapping legends).
