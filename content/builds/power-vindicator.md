## Notes

---

Power Vindicator is a very strong and straightforward damage build for instanced content. The iteration provided here uses Dual Swords, but it works in a similar way with Hammer and Greatsword too.

Vindicator also a great pick for solo gameplay, as it can provide itself with good amounts of the most essential offensive and defensive boons: Quickness, Protection, Fury and Might. Through its frequent Dodges, it can avoid a lot of incoming damage and therefore be quite survivable, even in damage gear.

{{ heavy(stat="Berserker's", rune="Draonhunter") }}
{{ sword_main(stat="Berserker's", sigil="Force") }}
{{ sword_off(stat="Berserker's", sigil="Air") }}
{{ trinkets(stat="Berserker's", relic="Thief") }}

> {{ item(id="104241", name="Relic of the Eagle") }} is an almost equally good alternative

## Build Concept

---

#### Dodge & {{ trait(id="2262") }}

- On Vindicator, your Dodge becomes an integral part of your damage rotation. Instead of diving into a specific direaction, it causes you to "jump" into the Mists and deal damage upon landing by default.
- With {{ trait(id="2257") }}, you gain 25% Strike damage done for 10 seconds whenever you Dodge. This is one of the strongest single damage modifiers in the game. It is therefore crucial to Dodge at least once every 10 seconds.
- That's not a problem though, because {{ skill(id="62693") }} is great damage while providing that damage modifier.
- The Dodge requirement is reinforced by {{ trait(id="2258") }}, which increases your damage done when your Endurance is not full.

#### {{ skill(id="62757") }}

- Another part of the profession mechanics is {{ skill(id="62757") }}.
- By default, this grants you 25 Endurance for 10 Energy.
- In the damage rotation, we'll use {{ trait(id="2259") }} to reduce the cooldown of {{ skill(id="62757") }} and double the damage that our Dodges deal.
- In case you want to have extra Energy on demand, you can also make use of {{ trait(id="2243") }}. This removes the Energy cost and grants 25 Energy instead. This can be helpful if you want to use costly skills.
