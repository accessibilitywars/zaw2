### SPECIAL NOTE

This is one of our more challenging builds. It's relatively simple, but unforgiving. It is also a 'Flavour of the Month' class, and might get nerfed in the future. Right now it is massively overperforming so even if it is nerfed, it should still perform reasonably well.

## Gearing

- Full Berserker's
- Runes of the Scholar
- Sword, Sigil of Force
- Shield, Sigil of Air
- Relic of the Thief
- Consumables:
  - Cilantro Lime Sous-Vide Steak (Power/Ferocity)
  - Superior Sharpening Stone (Power)

## Notes

There are a few priority levels to follow, that are layered on top of a simple rotation structure.

Start by preheating to ~100 Heat. You can maintain your heat level by equipping a musical instrument after preheating. The recommended instrument to use is the Unbreakable Choir Bell, which costs less than 1 silver on the TP, but you can use any instrument you like.

Your rotation consists of 2 main parts,

1. In Forge  
1. Out Forge

and is looped repeatedly.

In Forge rotation:

1. {{ skill(id="44530") }} (Forge 3)  
1. {{ skill(id="45783") }} (Forge 4) + {{ skill(id="42163") }}  
1. {{ skill(id="44530") }} (Forge 3)  
1. {{ skill(id="41123") }}

Out Forge rotation:
1. {{ skill(id="44110") }} (Sword 2) off cooldown  
1. Auto attack  
1. {{ skill(id="42938") }} @ ~80 Heat

On top of this rotation, there are 2 layers of cooldown based priority button pressing.

Layer 1:

1. {{ skill(id="45732") }}  
1. {{ skill(id="6178") }}

Both of these skills have no cast time and will not interrupt any skill casts and should therefore be pressed whenever they are off cooldown.

Layer 2:

1. {{ skill(id="43739") }} (press twice)  
1. {{ skill(id="42842") }}  
1. {{ skill(id="42009") }}

There are 2 parts of the rotation where you should check if these skills are off cooldown, after step 2 during In Forge rotation, and after using {{ skill(id="44110") }} (Sword 2) once in Out Forge rotation. If the skills are off cooldown during the check, use them.

You have very nice utilities with the Shield. You can bring a Pistol instead for about 1k+ more DPS, but I will always recommend the Shield over Pistol. 

{{ skill(id="6053") }} (Shield 4) is a 3s long projectile reflect, and can be pressed twice in quick succession for CC. 

{{ skill(id="6054") }} (Shield 5) is a 2.5s long block, and is basically your panic button. It can also be pressed twice in quick succession for CC.

{{ skill(id="21659") }} is also a good panic button, as it heals you and prevents you from downing to lethal damage for 5 seconds. This is usually used in more advanced group to skip mechanics.

Finally, you have 1 more CC skill, {{ skill(id="21661") }}. It should be your first option when it comes to CC, followed by {{ skill(id="6053") }} (Shield 4) and {{ skill(id="6054") }} (Shield 5).
