The purpose of writing this guide is to provide an ultra low intensity method to play PvE dragonhunter while easily hitting the 70% benchmark with minimal effort. This build is low cognition, low physical complexity, has very few repetitions and is functional in instanced content. The utilities do not require specific timing and do not interrupt the auto attack nature of the build. This build requires only one weapon to deal damage to near competitive levels with no requirement of a weapon swap: Hammer!


## Gearing and Consumables
**Equipment**
- Full Assassins's up to the crit cap (75%), in favour of Berserker's pieces
- For a slight DPS loss, you may use a few Marauder's pieces for extra vitality
- Hammer
- Weapon swap is optional

**Trait Alternatives**
There is a Core Guardian variant which provides more selfless support but due to the large amounts of gear differences (crit requirement at 40% only), it will not be covered in this guide. Although somewhat repetitive (spamming virtues) and dependent on resolution uptime, it remains a very strong contender and in many situations superior to this build.


## Rotation and Utilities
**DPS Rotation**
1. Precasts - {{ skill(id="30273") }} (elite)
2. Opening - {{ skill(id="9124") }} (Hammer 4)
3. Use {{ skill(id="29786") }} and {{ skill(id="9245") }} on cooldown. You may try to time these when Relic of the Brawler is active.

**Crowd Control rotation**
1. You have decent CC by just using {{ skill(id="9124") }} (Hammer 4) and {{ skill(id="9260") }} (Hammer 3). 
2. You can precast {{ skill(id="30273") }} (elite) for additional CC just before the CC phase of an encounter. 

**Sustainability**
1. You may opt to take {{ skill(id="30461") }} for passive healing.
2. Your autos generate perma protection and your symbols heal you.
3. {{ skill(id="9245") }} for condi cleanse
4. {{ skill(id="9153") }} or {{ skill(id="30553") }} provides group stability and a stun break

**Other Utilities and extra style points**
You may drop {{ skill(id="9245") }} for different utilities.
- {{ skill(id="9247") }} allows you to shadow step through mechanics
- You can also pair this while casting {{ skill(id="9195") }} for a Teleport CC



## Optimisation
**Cleave**
The dragonhunter variant has a larger cleave radius than its core counterpart. The pull, power cleave and trap combo is extremely useful when taking down adds.

A few examples where this advantage can be used are:
1. Harvest Temple - Any phase with adds.
2. W2 Slothasor and its slublings, F1 is a targeted pull that can avoid pulling allies. The cleave effect can take down slublings fast!
3. Fighting adds on W3 towers.
4. W3 Keep Contruct and the Adds
5. W6 Sword and Shields

**Raid Ready**
1. W1 Gorseval - Immobilise your spirit with {{ skill(id="9151") }} and {{ skill(id="9260") }} (Hammer 3)
2. W2 Bandit Trio - The self sustainability and high amounts of CC allow this build to do mortars very efficiently.
3. W3 escort - For backwarg, bring {{ skill(id="9151") }} which gives a generous 6s immobilise. You have other skills that can immobilise and cripple too!
4. W6 Qadim - You may choose to use this build instead if 2 players are sent to do Lamp. 

_Caution: Leftover traps on the arena can trigger mechanics e.g._
- _ball mechanic on KC_
- _killing tormented dead (you don't want to bring this build to SH!)_


## Videos
I have benched the build with mostly Assassin's and a handful Marauders Gear and budget food/utilities. 1 precise infusion is used to hit the 75% critical sweetspot.
