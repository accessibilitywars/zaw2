## Notes

---
#### Granting Alacrity
---
You give Alacrity with Morph Skills:
> 1. {{ skill(id="76806") }}  
> 1. {{ skill(id="76815") }}  
> 1. {{ skill(id="77163") }}

> - <small>You may replace {{ skill(id="76815") }} with another protocol of choice for additional utility.</small>
> - <small>You should use these skills on cooldown to ensure Alacrity doesn't drop.</small> 
> - <small>{{ skill(id="76806") }} and {{ skill(id="77163") }} are your main damage buffs.</small>

---
#### Rotation
---
1. Precast {{ skill(id="5836") }} and **DO NOT** {{ skill(id="5985") }}
2. Use all your skills off-cooldown except your non-alac CC and healing skills

---
#### CC skills
---
1. {{ skill(id="21661") }} (AED Toolbelt)
2. {{ skill(id="72977") }} (Spear 4)
3. {{ skill(id="76815") }} (used in DPS rotation)
4. {{ skill(id="76993") }} (used in DPS rotation)

#### Sustainability
1. {{ skill(id="76908") }} is an evade stance
2. AED can bypass many mechanics. 
3. {{ item(id="106364") }} or {{ item(id="106206") for Open-world
