Probably the easiest to play Alacrity build

## Gearing

- Berserker's + Diviner's mix [^1]
- Runes of the Scholar
- Sword, Sigil of Force
- Shield, Sigil of Air
- Relic of the Thief
- Consumables:
  - Cilantro Lime Sous-Vide Steak (Power/Ferocity)
  - Superior Sharpening Stone (Power)
 
[^1]: You want to swap out Berserker's gear for Diviner's until you have above 20% boon duration while maintaining at least 45% critical chance. I recommend swapping an Amulet and 2 Rings for highest cost effectiveness, but this can be done in a variety of ways.

## Notes

You give Alacrity with:
1. {{ skill(id="63262") }}  
1. {{ skill(id="63293") }}  
1. {{ skill(id="63141") }}

And you should prioritise these 3 skills above all else. {{ skill(id="63293") }} and {{ skill(id="63141") }} are Mech skills, and can be autocasted. However, due to Mech positioning, you may find yourself dropping Alacrity near the starts of fights, for the 1st and 2nd round of rotations. You should manually cast {{ skill(id="63293") }} and {{ skill(id="63141") }} during your first 2 loops to ensure Alacrity doesn't drop.

Press

1. {{ skill(id="44110") }} (Sword 2)  
1. {{ skill(id="40160") }} (Sword 3)  
1. {{ skill(id="63095") }}  

off cooldown, and that is basically your rotation.

Your auto attack chain reduces the cooldown of {{ skill(id="44110") }} (Sword 2) and {{ skill(id="40160") }} (Sword 3), allowing you to cast them more often. This lines up pretty well and results in you being able to use {{ skill(id="40160") }} (Sword 3) every other time you use {{ skill(id="44110") }} (Sword 2).

You have very nice utilities with the Shield. You can bring a Pistol instead for about ~800 more DPS, but I will always recommend the Shield over Pistol. 

{{ skill(id="6053") }} (Shield 4) is a 3s long projectile reflect, and can be pressed twice in quick succession for CC. 

{{ skill(id="6054") }} (Shield 5) is a 2.5s long block, and is basically your panic button. It can also be pressed twice in quick succession for CC.

On top of that, you have {{ skill(id="63095") }}, which is a CC skill even though it is used primarily for damage. Finally, you have {{ skill(id="63253") }}, which is another CC skill, but you should only use it in the most dire of situations, as using it is a DPS loss.
