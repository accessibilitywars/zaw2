## Build

{{ chatlink(code="[&DQkPKgM2NDfcEdwRBhIGEisSKxLUEdQRyhHKEQIDAgAGEisS1BEAAAAAAAADawA1AAUAAA==]") }}

## Notes

Use:
1. {{ skill(id="27107") }} while in {{ skill(id="28134") }}  
1. {{ skill(id="26557") }} while in {{ skill(id="28419") }}

and swap legends off cooldown. You can bind both these skills to the same button to reduce mistakes.

Use off cooldown:

1. {{ skill(id="27074") }} (Sword 5)
1. {{ skill(id="28472") }} (Sword 4)
1. {{ skill(id="29233") }} (Sword 2)

Following the above, you should never run out of energy, unless you have to CC.

## Crowd Control

You need to weapon swap to your Staff for your biggest CC skill, {{ skill(id="28978") }} (Staff 5). This is a big DPS loss, but is also one of the highest CC skills in the game. If you do swap to staff, just keep either {{ skill(id="27107") }} or {{ skill(id="26557") }} active and auto attack until you can swap back to Swords. You should still swap legends off cooldown.

If you do not want to weapon swap, your CC skills are:
1. {{ skill(id="28472") }} (Sword 4)
1. {{ skill(id="29233") }} (Sword 2)
1. {{ skill(id="28406") }} (in {{ skill(id="28134") }})  
1. {{ skill(id="26679") }} (in {{ skill(id="28419") }})
