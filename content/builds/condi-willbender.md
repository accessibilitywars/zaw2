## Build

## Notes

Your main combo is:
1. {{ skill(id="9187") }}
1. {{ skill(id="62668") }}
1. {{ skill(id="62565") }}

And you should prioritise this combo whenever {{ skill(id="9187") }} is off cooldown.

Using {{ skill(id="62668") }} activates Willbender Flames, which allows you to apply stacks of burning every hit. {{ skill(id="62565") }} and {{ skill(id="9187") }} both have multiple hits, which synergises well. It also swirls within the fire field created by {{ skill(id="9187") }}, generating burning bolts.

However, {{ skill(id="62668") }} has a shorter cool down than {{ skill(id="9187") }}, and you should use it a second time off cooldown outside of the main combo.

You might also run into a situation where {{ skill(id="9187") }} and {{ skill(id="62668") }} are desynced. If that happens, you should continue to use both {{ skill(id="9187") }} and {{ skill(id="62668") }} off cooldown out of sync, and combo {{ skill(id="62668") }} with {{ skill(id="62565") }}.

Beyond your main rotation, you should use:
1. {{ skill(id="9104") }} (Torch 4)
1. {{ skill(id="71987") }} (Pistol 3)
1. {{ skill(id="71968") }} (Pistol 2)

Off cooldown and in that order of priority. 

Pressing Zealot's Flame activates {{ skill(id="9089") }}, and you should press it when all other skills are on cooldown.

{{ skill(id="71968") }} (Pistol 2) has a very long cast time, and you should be wary of using it right before your main combo, as delaying the main combo results in a much larger DPS loss than delaying {{ skill(id="71968") }} (Pistol 2).

## Crowd Control

You only have 1 CC skill, {{ skill(id="62562") }}, with a very short cooldown of 20s (15s with Alacrity), but that's enough CC to carry your own weight in every encounter in the game, as it does quite a bit of breakbar damage at 450.
