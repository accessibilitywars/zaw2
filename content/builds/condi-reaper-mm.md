# Overview 

This open-world minion master excels when it's horde _dies_. You want to cycle through minions rapidly and often.

- Step 1: Summon horde
- Step 2: Exploit horde
- Step 3: Repeat

Note that this does not peform well with single-target situations, as "Rise!" fuels much of the damage in this build.

## Notes

- Spawn all minions to distract enemies
- Go into {{ skill(name="Reaper's Shroud") }}, drop an ice field with {{ skill(id="30557", name="Executioner's Scythe") }}
- Use {{ skill(id="30504", name="Soul Spiral") }} in the ice field
- When out of shroud, use {{ skill(name="Rise!") }} when you can hit at least 3 enemies, and then build life force
- When your minions die, they will spawn poison fields due to {{ trait(name="death nova") }}. Poison application also grants Carapace as well as causing some damage and inhibiting enemy healing.
- Try to combo {{ skill(id="30504", name="Soul Spiral") }} in the poison fields to create additional poison bolts

# Crowd Control
