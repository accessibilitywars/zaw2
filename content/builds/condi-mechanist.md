This mechanist build is all-signets, and no kit usage, for simple play

## Gearing

- Armor: Viper's with Runes of the Trapper
- Trinkets: Viper's
- Weapons: Viper's Pistol/Pistol with Sigils of Bursting/Earth
- Relic of the Fractal
- Food & Utility: Cilantro Flatbread & Toxic Focusing Crystal

## Build

{{ chatlink(code="[&DQMGJyY5RjUNGwAAGhsAAA4bAAAQGwAACRsAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=]") }}

## Notes

Use all skills off cooldown in the following priority order:

1. {{ skill(name="Blowtorch") }}
2. {{ skill(name="Static Shot") }}
3. {{ skill(name="Poison Dart Volley") }}
4. {{ skill(name="Superconducting Signet") }}
5. {{ skill(name="Overclock Signet") }}

Your CC skills are, in order of priority:

1. {{ skill(name="Force Signet") }}
2. {{ skill(id="5830") }}
3. {{ skill(name="Crash Down") }} (by unsummoning and summoning Mech)
4. {{ skill(name="Static Shot") }} (which makes your Mech do Rocket Punch, but since the cooldown for Rocket Punch is longer that the skill, it might not have CC)

I actually forgot to put on my Sigil of Bursting, so this build does easily ~1k more DPS than the number in the log. You can expect 33.5k DPS.
