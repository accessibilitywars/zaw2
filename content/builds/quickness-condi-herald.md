This build uses 7 key skills in its rotation without weapon swap. With only 2 short bow skills {{ skill(id="41829") }} and {{ skill(id="40175") }}, this build avoids high energy skills in Mallyx allows energy management to frequently trigger torment through {{ skill(id="28287") }}. The ranged nature of the build allows higher damage uptime, less button presses and the relics and sigils are focused on stacking as much torment as possible.

#### Equipment
|Equipment      | Stats         | Rune/Sigil/Relic|
| ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Armor         | Viper's       | {{ item(id="67339") }} |
| Short Bow     | Viper's       | {{ item(id="44950") }}<br>{{ item(id="48911") }} |
| Trinkets      | Viper's       | {{ item(id="100153") }} |

## Weapon Swaps (optional)
1. Mace/Axe - This does more damage in theory. However, in practice, the melee range may cause you to miss hits, thus swapping to bow is useful. For the purpose of a low intensity guide, we will be discussing bow as the default. 
2. Staff - This may be used for large amounts of CC, but is detrimental to your DPS. This isto  be used situationally only.

#### Trait Alternatives
The equipment stats are fairly similar to the that of [SnowCrows](https://snowcrows.com/builds/raids/revenant/condition-quickness-herald) with selection of different sigils. If you would like to incorporate weapon swaps into your rotation and optimise your damage, refer to the SnowCrows guide.

## Rotation
#### Generating Quickness in Glint
1. {{ skill(id="27760") }} (upkeep, precast) 
2. {{ skill(id="28379") }} (upkeep, opener) 

<small>You will automatically generate quickness through {{ trait(id="1746") }}</small>

#### Consuming skills (on cooldown)
3. {{ skill(id="26644") }} -> {{ skill(id="28113") }}
4. {{ skill(id="27014") }} -> {{ skill(id="27162") }} (Ground Targeted) 
Swap to {{ skill(id="28376") }} after consuming strength second time. 

#### Generating Quickness in Mallyx
5. {{ skill(id="28287") }} (upkeep)
Swap to {{ skill(id="28085") }} when out of energy,

#### Weapon Rotation
6. {{ skill(id="40175") }} (Short Bow 2)
7. {{ skill(id="41829") }} (Short Bow 3)
If you end up having excess energy because you messed up your rotation, you can use {{ skill(id="43993") }} Bow 4. However if executed properly, this is a very energy hungry build and you should not have enough.

#### Weapon Rotation (alt)
6. {{ skill(id="28357") }} (Mace 2)
7. {{ skill(id="27964") }} (Mace 3)
If you end up having excess energy because you messed up your rotation, you can use {{ skill(id="28409") }} (Axe 5). However if executed properly, this is a very energy hungry build and you should not have enough.

<br><small>The above skills 1-5 occur in a loop while weapon skills are available on all stances and can be performed anytime.</small>

#### Optional Support
True Nature (on cooldown)
This skill is not necessary to upkeep quickness and is neglible to DPS. However it can extend other boons and is thus included to assist your healer.

## Optimisation

2. {{ skill(id="28409") }} is always available (Axe 5)
