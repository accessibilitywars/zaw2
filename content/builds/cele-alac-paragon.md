## Notes
---

This is a build which uses Celestial gear and hybrid traits to maximise the sword's physical prowress and bleeding capabilities. This build is designed to replace a dedicated healer slot. This is a more tanky version of the grieving hybrid build but relies on more complex core mechanics to provideb sustained boons and healing. 

Hybrid healing builds have a lot of give and take and toe the line to bring 'just enough', so you need to adjust the build to the strengths of your team composition.

## Rotation
---

#### Opener
Your ability to perform the opener will depend on the boss and you may need to swap the order of the skills.
> 1. Charge adrenaline (command skills and signet)
> 1. {{ skill(id="77342") }}
> 1. Use warhorn skills for boons
> 1. Weapon swap ⚔

#### DPS rotation
Use the following off-cooldown
> 1. {{ skill(id="14428") }} (⚔ Burst)
> 1. {{ skill(id="14498") }} (⚔ 4)
> 1. {{ skill(id="14497") }} (⚔ 3)

#### General House Rules
> 1. Your primary goal is to maintain alacrity and your party's survivability before DPS 
> 1. You need to maintain 7-10 motivations
> 1. Timing your burst with {{ skill(id="1480") }} will improve your might uptime.

#### Crowd Control
This build has very poor CC options and you may bring additional CC through weapon swaps. The details are covered in the heal and hybrid DPS guide.

#### Sustain in Open World
> 1. Use **Relic of the Biomancer** for baseline healing
> 2. Swap to dagger for boon strip and better survivability
