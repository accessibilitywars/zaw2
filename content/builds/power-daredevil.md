## Build

{{ chatlink(code="[&DQUjGxw9BzmFAAwBWAFXAVcBMwEzAQAADgEoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACNgBZAAA=]") }}

## Notes

There are 2 main resources you have to manage in this rotation, Initiative and Endurance, and 2 buffs to upkeep, Relic of the Thief and {{ trait(name="bounding dodger") }}. 

Your skills cost initiative to cast but have no cooldown, and casting a skill refreshes Relic of the Thief uptime. Since {{ skill(id="29911") }} is your most damage per initiative skill, you want to use it as much as possible.

Dodging activates {{ trait(name="bounding dodger") }}, but costs endurance.

Thankfully there is an easy way to manage and maintain all of these resources and uptimes.

Opener:
1) Dodge to start the fight
2) Use all your initiative on {{ skill(id="29911") }}
3) Dodge

Loop:
1. Use 2 full auto attack chains
2. Dodge
3. Use all your initiative on {{ skill(id="29911") }}
4. Repeat

If you run out of stamina and cannot dodge after using 2 full auto attack chains, do 1 more auto attack chain for a total of 3 auto attack chains, then continue with step 2.

Your final attack in the auto attack chain is a huge twirl of the staff, and is easier to see if you use a flashier staff skin. It also plays a very different sound from the first 2 attacks, and can be used as a point of reference.

## Crowd Control

You only realistically have 1 CC skill, that is {{ skill(id="13132") }}. However, it is also 1 of the most effective CC skills in the game, doing up to 750 defiance bar damage each time you use it.
