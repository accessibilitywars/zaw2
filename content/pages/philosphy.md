# Our Build Philosophy

We aim to create builds that include accomodations to allow players to engage with end-game content. We call
these, appropriately enough, Accessible Builds.

Most of our builds are currently tuned for instanced PvE balance (raids, strikes, fractals). Builds marked
[solo](/categories/solo) are good candidates for self-sufficient open world play and have broader use.

# Benchmarking

We provide benchmarks to most builds, and where possible, video demonstrations. These rotations and
playstyles are intentionally designed so that almost any player will be able to bring it to the Lionâ€™s Arch
Aerodrome golem, and achieve the set benchmark, even at ~300 ping. They are also designed to be playable in
actual play, when one has to react to mechanics.

We don't heavily optimize our benchmark attempts. Experienced players should be able to beat our DPS benchmark
without changes.

# Classificiation

Our build listing pages are organized in various ways. There are a few custom index pages:

- [profession/elite specialization](/specs)
- [solo/group](/categories)
- [balance patch](/balance)
- [chronologically](/archive)

All other criteria are organized with a [tag system](/tags). You can filter by:

- expansion
- weapon
- power/condi/hybrid
- various accommodation needs, as listed below

### SOLO

[Solo Builds](/categories/solo) are self-ish. They are generally built for use in open world scenarios, where
one can't depend on having group boon support.  They will also not generally provide boons to others, unless
it's 'free' to do so.

### GROUP

[Group Builds](/categories/group) are designed for use in an instanced PvE group, particularly raids and strikes.
Some builds may also be useful in fractals or organized open world events like map meta-events.

### LOWCOG

[Low Cog Builds](/tags/#lowcog) have low cognitive complexity. These builds have less decisions, lower
memorization/knowledge requirements, and definitely no long rotations. We aim to keep to a maximum of 3 actions
in a combo when possible.

### LOWPHYS

[Low Phys Builds](/tags/#lowphys) have low physical complexity. These builds don't use too many _different_ buttons.
The goal is to minimize lateral finger movement on the keyboard/mouse/controller.

### LOWREP

[Low Rep Builds](/tags/#lowrep) have low physical repetition. These builds have a reduced need to press the _same_
button rapidly. We lean on autos, and the ability to hold the weapon key down in many cases here. Note that,
particularly with these builds, there may be a difference for users of Action Camera.

## Finally...

We don't hold a monopoly on Accessible Builds here at Accessibility Wars.
