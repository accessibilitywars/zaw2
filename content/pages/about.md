## Our Mission

We are a community of Guild Wars 2 gamers with accessibility needs.  We aim to help accommodate a wide range of needs, from
physical to cognitive. To this end, with the help of the community, we publish and archive accessible builds that can allow
players to solo more difficult content, and comfortably contribute in group play across game modes.
