# Our Mission

We are a community of Guild Wars 2 gamers with accessibility needs and creators that support them.

We aim to help accommodate a wide range of needs, from physical to cognitive. We provide a repository of builds and resources,
with the goal of allowing players to access more difficult content and comfortably contribute in group play.
